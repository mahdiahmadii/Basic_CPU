# Basic CPU - Proteus Design

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Simple CPU designed using Proteus. This project showcases a fully-functional Central Processing Unit (CPU) implemented in Proteus. The CPU includes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), a Control Unit (CU), an Instruction Register (INPR), an Output Register (OUTR), a Control Read-Only Memory (ROM), an Address Read-Only Memory (ROM), and a Random Access Memory (RAM). The CPU supports a total of 16 logic operations, 6 arithmetic operations, and 4 shift operations.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Proteus software installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-cpu-proteus.git
   ```

2. Open Proteus software and import the project files.

## Usage

1. Open the Proteus project containing the Simple CPU design.
2. Connect any required input devices and configure the desired output devices.
3. Run the simulation to observe the CPU executing various instructions.
4. Utilize the control signals and input data to test different logic, arithmetic, and shift operations.
